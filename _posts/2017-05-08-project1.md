Here will be some kind of description about the project, why I did it, what makes it interesting that sort of thing. It needs to have space for quite a bit of information incase there’s lot to say. For example on my uni pieces there will be a fair chunk.

Maybe even extra paragraphs would be useful. I’d rather have too much to say than leaving it strangely blank. Obviously I don’t want to go on for ages and ages though. I guess that’s something I’ll need to work out as.

I’m typing all the descriptions out.
