_University project_

The goal of this project was to typeset samples as a proposed series design '_Reading Classics_'. The series contained a wide range of titles and genres: from prose to poetry, drama to translated parallel texts.

I used Arno Pro as the typeface because of it's versatile range of weights and extensive character set. Unlike typefaces re-drawn from pre-digital forms, Arno Pro was created for digital use whilst finding the same level of gravity on the page to carry the well-respected texts.

It was a real challenge to create a succint list of styles that could be applied to any given typographic or editorial situation; from the long lists of '_War and Peace_' to the minute detail of '_Henry V_'.
