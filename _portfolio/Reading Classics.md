University project

The goal of this project was to typeset samples a proposed series design 'Reading Classics'. The series contained a wide range of titles and genres: from prose to poetry, drama to translated parallel texts.

I used Arno Pro as the typeface because of it's versatile range of weights and extensive character set. Unlike typefaces re-drawn from pre-digital forms, Arno Pro was created for digital use whilst finding the same level of gravity on the page to carry the well-respected texts.
