_University project_

At the end of each design project as part of the MA course each student was required to write a report detailing the 'Discovery', 'Transformation', and 'Making' phase of their work, and to also create a design specification.

This self-printed and bound book is a collation of my own five reports and includes images of the final deliverables and any extra parts created for the final exhibition of my work. It was originally created to accompany my display of work at the end of the educational year, but now acts as a reminder of what I acheived and how far I have come as a designer. All of my ideas, both bad and good, are recorded in detail in this document along with a complete visual progression of the projects from intial ideas to final creation.

Despite not being submitted for marking, this was one of my favourite documents created whilst at uni. Everything about it was made by me, both the content; writing and images, and the physical item; design, printing and final binding. At 301 A4-sized pages it is a substantial book; the book itself, regardless of pure content, serves perfectly as an example of what I learned over the year and how I am as a book designer.

To avoid clashing or matching with any designs contained within, the design of the reports is purposefully bland. I used the Source family of fonts to have plenty of typographic scope without stepping on the visual toes of my other projects. I chose a mild red for the accent colour because, a) I like it, and b) it was different to any major colour used before in my work.

Section dividers made from red 300gsm stock are bound into the book block using a French stitch. In order to easily have a printed cover I half-bound the cover in bookcloth and carefully applied the red cardstock to the rest.
