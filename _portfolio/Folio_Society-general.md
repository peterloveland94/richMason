_Freelance work_

Since January 2020 I have been working as a Freelancer for the [Folio Society](https://www.foliosociety.com/uk) after setting up intial contact via a [university project](https://richardmasondesign.com/client-directed).

I have been lucky enough to work on a great range of projects and have kindly been given permission to use some of their photographs here.

On this page are the projects I have only had a smaller part in the production of. This is mostly tasks like taking in editorial changes or typesetting an introduction or index.

All the freelance work I have done with the Folio Society, no matter how small, has been an enjoyable and invaluable experience, both in office and home-working. I adore their style of publishing and to have any part in the publishing process is amazing, especially when you get to see the final volume finished!

The books shown here are not an exhaustive list of the publications I have worked on in some capacity; however, I need to make clear I have had little creative input on them, usually following a pre-styled template but nonetheless using my knowledge of quality typography.

There would often be a complicated or awkward page break that took a lot of careful typographic 'jiggling' to fix, or a spelling change that could completely alter the shape of a paragraph.
