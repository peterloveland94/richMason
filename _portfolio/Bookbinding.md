_Personal project_

From time to time I like to get folding and practice my stitching and binding techniques. Here are just a few photos of the kind of thing I've created. I like to try different methods and styles, seeing what works and what doesn't. There's usually a lot more that doesn't than does, but that's all the fun of it!
