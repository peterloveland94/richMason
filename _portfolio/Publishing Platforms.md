University project

This project studies internet culture and post-digital publishing. All the content for this book is either from an open source, or created by me.

This publication acts as a guide to the upcoming UK porn block by pointing readers to three case studies about online censorship of adult content and suggests other sites and blogs for them to find further reading.

You can read and download the epub on <a  href="https://archive.org/details/CanaryInTheCoalMine_2019">The Internet Archive</a> or buy the Print-on-Demand version on <a  href="www.blurb.co.uk/b/9486464-canary-in-the-coal-mine">Blurb.com</a>
