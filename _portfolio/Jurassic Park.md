_Freelance work_

Of the large variety of work I have done for the Folio Society this project stands out for me as particularly memorable. Whilst not being illustrations in the typical sense, the range of screenshots, diagrams, and graphs I created for Jurassic Park are detached from the pure typography of the novel but are included within the layout of the spreads they inhabit.

The basic layout of these elements were taken from the original publisher's hand-drawn illustrations. I was hired to re-create these in a digital and of-the-era style using an authentic 1980s computer font. This really helps transport the reader into the early '90s and helps us empathise with the confused users of the Park's computer security system.

I had so much fun creating images with a mono-spaced typeface and box-drawing characters I was inspired to continue experimenting, which led to me creating the [Gutenberg BIOS](/bios-bible.html) and the [BIOS Tube Map](/bios-style-map.html).

This was also the first printed and published freelance work I owned. It was particularly satisfying to read through the novel and see my own work printed out.
