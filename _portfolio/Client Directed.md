_University project_

Unlike my other uni projects this was a client-led projects to teach and gain experience in the real-world. The client for this project was the Folio Society, who briefed me and supervised my progress with the designs.

To work with this client whilst still at uni was a genuine treat for me. I particularly enjoyed working on this project and the intense tyopgraphic setting needed to recreate the professional standard. In particular I wanted to create a high-quality dummy to include in my submission, and in doing so learnt much about bookbinding; folding, stitching, gluing and binding.

I used contemporary images for the binding and title page designs, adapting them to fit the space and tone of the book.
