University project

This project involved deciding on a concept for a Home Reference 'How-to' Manual, writing the text and creating the imagery. My concept was 'Folded', a guide on storing and decorating with fabrics and materials for every room in the house.

The biggest challenge on this project for me was photographing the objects well enough for printing and accurate representation.
