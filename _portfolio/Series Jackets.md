_University project_

For this project we proposed a series of books; either already existing, or of our own creation, for re-publishing and re-designing.

I chose to use classic humour titles as no solely humour series exisits — or is easily found at least — but it is a genre that can be hard to follow, spreading out across all other genres. This series would bring together the very best titles under one style for easily finding your next read.

Each cover uses a famous quote from the book set in a quirky manner that gives a visual nod to the meaning of the quote that readers familiar with the book will understand; for example in '_The Diary of a Nobody_' the diarist, Mr Pooter, claims multiple times, 'I don't often make jokes'.

The debossed border around the quote helps differentiate the title and author from the quote clearly defining the repeated and independant parts of the series design.
