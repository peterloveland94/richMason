University project

For this project we proposed a series of books; either already existing, or of our own creation, for re-publishing and re-designing.

I chose to use classic humour titles as no solely humour series exisits — or is easily found at least — but it is a genre that can be hard to follow, spreading out across all other genres. This series would bring together the very best titles under one style for easily finding your next read.
