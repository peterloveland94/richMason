<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>Let me introduce myself.</p>
<p>I'm a freelance book designer, trained on my MA in Book Design at the University of Reading.</p>
<p>I have worked as a B2B agency marketing designer for companies like Verizon and Vodafone doing all sorts projects; from presentations to animations, banners to brochures. I'm very comfortable working within brand guidelines and pushing to get the absolute best design out of them. It was here I learnt how to adapt on the job to please clients, how to get to grips with new software or techniques and still produce high quality work on time.</p>
<p>Since graduating my Master's Degree with a distinction I have continued and honed my love of book design, I always want to experiment with a new idea or concept. I have recently been freelancing for the Folio Society taking on all sorts of projects from editorial changes, scanning comics, illustrating diagrams, to typesetting whole books. This is the kind of work that I can't get enough of; getting to be part of the process of creating such beautiful books is a pleasure.</p>
<p>As well as designing and typesetting books, I also enjoy making books. I started bookbinding at Uni, designing and creating a whole book from scratch as my final project; be sure to check it out <a href="https://richardmasondesign.com/client-directed">here</a>!<p>
<p>From time to time I like to get back to the basics of book design and do some binding and stitching. Nothing will make you appreciate the work that goes into a book like creating one from a pile of paper and string!<p>
<p>Basically what you need to know about me is: if it's got typography, I'm interested.</p>
<p>Have a look at my work, and please don't hesitate to get in touch with me, I'd love to answer any questions you might have.</p><br>
